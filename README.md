# ToDo App

## Description

This app was purely developed for learning purposes. It is a simple ToDo app that allows you to add, edit and delete tasks. It also allows you to mark tasks as completed. The app is built using React. The app is also responsive and can be used on mobile devices.

## Learning Outcomes

As I mentioned that this app was purely developed for learning purposes, the main goal was to learn React. I have learned the following things while developing this app:

1. Use of State and Props
2. Use of React Hooks
3. Use of Tailwind CSS
4. Use of Material UI Icons

## Known Issues

As this project was developed while learning React, there are some known issues that I am aware of. These issues are:

1. The app is not using any database. It is using local storage to store the tasks. This means that if you refresh the page, all the tasks will be lost.
2. The app is not using any authentication. This means that anyone can access the app and add, edit or delete tasks.
3. Also I did use tailwind but the whole app is not using tailwind. I have used some CSS as well so sometime in the future will also have to fix it.
4. The app is only avialable with dark mode as for now. I will add light mode in the future. However the button is there but it is not working.
